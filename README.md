# How I felt
Node.js and Express was very hard at first to grasp. I spent good 30 minutes on trying to prompt user input. When I finally asked a help to my instructor, she reminded me on what she said in her lesson "Node.js is server side and it is very fun!". After I experienced what it is mean by back end, I started enjoying this powerful Node and I was able to see why many people likes Node.js and Express.
